* Blockchain is a superior digital store of value
* Scarce quantity 
* Ethereum was a new protocol (different features with blockchains)
* Smart contracts are self-executing solidity 
* The oracle problem - they are a walled garden, need world data
* Blockchains are oracles bring information in (centralized oracles would be a point of failure)
* Chainlink allows you hybrid smart contracts so you can bring information in 
* Ethereum is the most popular / one used 
* Chainlink is blockchain agnostic 
* Decentralized 
* Bankless narrative -> web3 can hopefully build a world where you don't need this anymore
* Everything is transparent and flexible (no special information - all play by the same rule)
* Speed and efficiency is another big value // settlement period is much faster 
* Security & Immutable (cannot be changed)
* Remove counterparty risk (they will always uphold the agreements)
* Trust minimized agreements // math based agreements 
* Hybrid smart contracts can bring off-chain information on-chain 
* Block explorers allow us to see transactions from other people on it 
* Transaction hashes are the keys of the transactions 
* Everytime you do something, you need to pay in gas fees 
* The blockchain can only process so many at a time, with high traffic, the high gas ones take priority 
* Hash is a unique number needed to identify piece of  data
* When block is mining, they are looking to find something that works for them to fit the hash
* Prev -> points to the hash of the past block  [genesis block = previous hash 0000000]
* Private key is used as a signature, and public key can verify the private key is the one
* Consensus - mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain
* Chain selection -> Sybil resistance: Ability to defend against pseudononymous
* PoW = Proof of Work = Single node has to mine to figure out or make any changes 
* PoW = Proof of Stake = 
* chain selection = nakamoto consensus (longest chain rule += proof of work // number of confirmations)
* miners and validators (proof of work / stake) are the ones that get paid
